Version 2.0 coming sometime in the future

Needless to say this program does work, but only displays pre-coded mentors and was my attempt at community development for developers . With that said I would make some major changes knowing what I know now. This is due to the fact that in programming variables can be whatever the programmer wants them to be. This makes word prediction difficult but not impossible. Next I would use some API probably GitHub's  to help predict the successful developers and gain their contact.
