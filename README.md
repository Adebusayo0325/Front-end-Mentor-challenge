Version 2.0 coming sometime in the future

Needless to say this program does work, but only displays pre-coded mentors and was my attempt at community development for developers . With that said I would make some major changes knowing what I know now. This is due to the fact that in programming variables can be whatever the programmer wants them to be. This makes word prediction difficult but not impossible. Next I would use some API probably GitHub's  to help predict the successful developers and gain their contact.

Project demo
Technical challenges

The most difficult technical challenges encountered include user verification as well as prison of alternative means to log in to their various accounts. It was  a great difficulty adding the rotating effect to the UI functionality as well as inclusion of auto updates to be  made from the GitHub API. It was difficult to activate arrangements to communicate with the Mentors at their free times, add the reject mentee functionality too. Installing the dependencies as well as downloading practical images and deciding on the overall look of UI. Testing of the Backend and Project idea reviews were also inconvenient to configure with individual schedules.
